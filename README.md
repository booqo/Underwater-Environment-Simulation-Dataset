# Underwater-Environment-Simulation-Dataset
This repository contains a dataset designed to simulate underwater environments under various lighting conditions. It consists of 6 sequences captured using a deep-sea stereo camera in a controlled underwater setting. The dataset is aimed at enhancing underwater image processing and 3D reconstruction methods, especially in low-light environments.
